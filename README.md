# PythonProjects
A portfolio of Python Projects.

Learning Python: these will be my forays into learning Python. I'll track my projects here with a quick note on what each project does.

Basic WEB Scraper

Scrapes pictures from a web site. It takes the URL and Download directory as inputs, and resumes download if interrupted. Logs errors.

Pivot Table

Input parameters are the input directory and two data columns that we want to use as indexes for the pivot table. The script reads all csv files in the input directory and loads them into one single data frame. Then creates a pivot table with the indexes given as input parameters.
